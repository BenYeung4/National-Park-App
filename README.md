## Welcome to the National Park App!

## Description
This app utilizes mainly Javascript to select a national park based on the State the user chooses. Once a user selects a state, the national parks of that state is presented to the user along with a park's short description; and a webpage link to that park to view more information about a park.

## Installation
After creating a repository called National-Park-App in GitHub, VS code was used to create files such as index.html, script.js, and styles.css associated with the app. The app is designed to work best on Google Chrome browser.

## Usage
This app can be used by nature enthusiasts to visit parks they liked in the past or parks that haven't been visited yet. The app allows the user to view park information and weather ahead of a trip.
